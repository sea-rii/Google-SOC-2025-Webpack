# Google-SOC-2025 - Tooling: Unified Webpack Dev Tools

## Abstract

Webpack’s development tools—webpack-dev-server, webpack-hot-middleware, and webpack-dev-middleware—are essential for local development, but their fragmented structure leads to duplication, inconsistent options, and a suboptimal user experience. This project aims to unify these tools into a streamlined ecosystem, reducing redundancy and enhancing maintainability.

I propose to: extract hot-reload and client logic into a new webpack-hmr-middleware package, migrate relevant functionality from webpack-hot-middleware (then deprecate it), and restructure webpack-dev-server as a monorepo housing webpack-dev-middleware, webpack-hmr-middleware, and a leaner webpack-dev-server.

## About Me

## Proposed Solution
I’ll unify webpack’s dev tools by:

1. Extracting HMR Logic: Create webpack-hmr-middleware to handle hot-reload and client-side logic, pulled from webpack-dev-server.
2. Migrating and Deprecating: Move webpack-hot-middleware’s relevant features to webpack-hmr-middleware, then mark it deprecated.
3. Monorepo Structure: Transform webpack-dev-server into a monorepo with:
   * webpack-dev-middleware (existing, unchanged).
   * webpack-hmr-middleware (new HMR package).
   * webpack-dev-server (a thin wrapper integrating the above).
4. Documentation: Update READMEs and webpack docs to reflect the new structure.
   
This will streamline development workflows, reduce maintenance, and clarify tool usage.

## Goals
1. Primary Deliverable: A functional monorepo with webpack-hmr-middleware, updated webpack-dev-server, and a deprecated webpack-hot-middleware.
2. Stretch Goals:
   * Add CLI options to webpack-hmr-middleware for standalone use.
   * Write a migration guide for webpack-hot-middleware users.
   * Integrate with webpack’s official docs site.

## Implementation Plan
Technologies
* Core: JavaScript, Node.js, webpack APIs (e.g., webpack-dev-middleware).
* Monorepo: Lerna or npm workspaces.
* Testing: Jest, integration tests with webpack configs.
* Dependencies: Existing webpack tools, express (for webpack-dev-server).

## Timeline
Duration: 12 weeks (~175 hours, ~15-20 hours/week).

Community Bonding (May 8 - June 1, 2025)
* Study webpack-dev-server, webpack-hot-middleware, and webpack-dev-middleware source code.
* Discuss scope and monorepo tooling (Lerna vs. npm) with mentors Alexander and Nitin.
* Set up GitHub repo and initial structure.
  
Week 1-2 (June 2 - June 15)
* Extract HMR and client logic from webpack-dev-server into webpack-hmr-middleware.
* Set up basic monorepo with webpack-dev-middleware and webpack-hmr-middleware.
* Deliverable: Working webpack-hmr-middleware package with HMR functionality.
  
Week 3-4 (June 16 - June 29)
* Migrate relevant options/logic from webpack-hot-middleware to webpack-hmr-middleware.
* Test compatibility with existing webpack-dev-server setups.
* Deliverable: Unified HMR middleware with migrated features.
  
Week 5-6 (June 30 - July 13)
* Refactor webpack-dev-server to depend on webpack-hmr-middleware.
* Mark webpack-hot-middleware as deprecated (update README, npm metadata).
* Midterm Evaluation: Monorepo with all three packages, basic docs.
  
Week 7-8 (July 14 - July 27)
* Polish webpack-hmr-middleware API and error handling.
* Write initial tests for all packages.
* Deliverable: Stable monorepo with passing tests.
  
Week 9-10 (July 28 - August 10)
* Incorporate mentor/community feedback.
* Add stretch goal (e.g., CLI options for webpack-hmr-middleware).
* Deliverable: Refined packages with one stretch feature.
  
Week 11-12 (August 11 - August 24)
* Finalize docs, tests, and npm publishing.
* Create demo video and submit GSoC report.
* Deliverable: Production-ready monorepo and deprecated webpack-hot-middleware.
  
Post-GSoC: Maintain the packages, assist with community adoption, and contribute to webpack further.
