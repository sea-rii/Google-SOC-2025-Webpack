# Google-SOC-2025 - Tooling: Unified Webpack Dev Tools

Abstract
Webpack’s development tools—webpack-dev-server, webpack-hot-middleware, and webpack-dev-middleware—are essential for local development, but their fragmented structure leads to duplication, inconsistent options, and a suboptimal user experience. This project aims to unify these tools into a streamlined ecosystem, reducing redundancy and enhancing maintainability.

I propose to: extract hot-reload and client logic into a new webpack-hmr-middleware package, migrate relevant functionality from webpack-hot-middleware (then deprecate it), and restructure webpack-dev-server as a monorepo housing webpack-dev-middleware, webpack-hmr-middleware, and a leaner webpack-dev-server.
