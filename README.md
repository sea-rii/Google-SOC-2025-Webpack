# Google-SOC-2025 - Tooling: Unified Webpack Dev Tools

## Abstract

Webpack’s development tools—webpack-dev-server, webpack-hot-middleware, and webpack-dev-middleware—are essential for local development, but their fragmented structure leads to duplication, inconsistent options, and a suboptimal user experience. This project aims to unify these tools into a streamlined ecosystem, reducing redundancy and enhancing maintainability.

I propose to: extract hot-reload and client logic into a new webpack-hmr-middleware package, migrate relevant functionality from webpack-hot-middleware (then deprecate it), and restructure webpack-dev-server as a monorepo housing webpack-dev-middleware, webpack-hmr-middleware, and a leaner webpack-dev-server.

## About Me

## Proposed Solution
I’ll unify webpack’s dev tools by:

1. Extracting HMR Logic: Create webpack-hmr-middleware to handle hot-reload and client-side logic, pulled from webpack-dev-server.
2. Migrating and Deprecating: Move webpack-hot-middleware’s relevant features to webpack-hmr-middleware, then mark it deprecated.
3. Monorepo Structure: Transform webpack-dev-server into a monorepo with:
   * webpack-dev-middleware (existing, unchanged).
   * webpack-hmr-middleware (new HMR package).
   * webpack-dev-server (a thin wrapper integrating the above).
4. Documentation: Update READMEs and webpack docs to reflect the new structure.
   
This will streamline development workflows, reduce maintenance, and clarify tool usage.
